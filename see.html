            		<p>There are a number of places to visit during your stay on the island. Apart from the many beach resorts with their sandy white beaches and blue lagoon, there are other "greener" sites that you might find interesting. The Black River Gorges, Macabee Forest and Yemen are regions, which you might discover on foot or by car. Trou aux Cerfs (an extinct volcanic crater), Chamarel (with its 7 coloured earth), Ile aux Aigrettes (an island of the South East Coast which is a natural reserve) are among the many sites you can experience during your stay in Mauritius.</p>
 
					<p>There are also a number of museums, fortifications, churches, galleries, colonial houses that are opened to the public. These places are a heritage of our rich colonial culture and history. Moreover religious festivals, especially Indian festivals are very colourful. This is a good way to experience Eastern culture without stepping out of Mauritius</p>

The garden is located in the proximity of Port-Louis in the district of Pamplemousse.</p>


<p>The botanical garden was initially opened as a private garden by the French governor of Mauritius nearly 300 years ago, later to become the national botanical garden of Mauritius.</p>

<p>The botanical garden stretches over endless acres of land and it may take you more than a week to cover the whole garden. It is populated with more than 650 varieties of plants among which are the famous Baobabs, the Palmier Bouteille, the ineluctable Giant Water Lilies, dozens of medicinal plants, a large spice garden and many more.</p>

<p>One of the main attractions of the botanical garden is the 85 different varieties of palm trees brought from different corners of the world. Other indigenous species of plants are also exhibited here.</p>

<p>The Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site was inscribed in 2006 under criteria VI as: </p>

<p>“The first site chosen by the British Government in 1834 for the great experiment in the use of indentured rather than slave Labour, is strongly associated with memories of almost half a million indentured labourers moving from India to Mauritius to work on sugarcane plantations or to be transshipped to other parts of the World.”</p>

            		<p>Port Louis (por loo-ee), the island's capital and largest city, can feel like a kaleidoscope of countries and cultures, with flashes of India, Africa, Europe, China and the Middle East. Unless you've essential business to transact here, or unless you're in the country for a prolonged visit, there aren't that many reasons to come – there are numerous other day excursions that we'd rank above Port Louis. But if you are here, it can be a good place to take the pulse of the country and to get an alternative slant on the island's rarefied world of resorts and private beaches. Most interest lies amid the bustle and chaos of the streets, the tangle of ethnic quarters and some wonderfully preserved colonial buildings. Apart from Le Caudan Waterfront, it all shuts down after dark when countless day commuters rumble out of town at sunset en route to their homes on the Central Plateau.</p>

As a result, it is also referred to as Ebene Cybercity or Cybercity.</p>

Ebene is a cable landing point of the SAFE high-speed submarine communications cable be<p>ween South Africa and Malaysia. It is also the home of AfriNIC, the Regional Internet Registry for Africa, and other IT companies.</p>

            		<p>As wonderful and whimsical as the name sounds, Flic en Flac isn't quite the picture of paradise you saw on your travel agent's website. The area's moniker is thought to be a corruption of the old Dutch name Fried Landt Flaak (meaning 'Free and Flat Land'); the endless acreage of sandy shoreline was undoubtedly striking when explorers first arrived in the 18th century. Today, the public beach is peppered with weeping filao trees, and the area is exploding with apartment complexes, souvenir shops, moneychangers and pinchpenny holiday rentals. Although development in Flic en Flac has gone the way of Grand Baie, it's still about a dozen clubs and restaurants short of attracting a party crowd in earnest.</p>

<p>All is not lost, however; the beach is still one of the best in Mauritius and if you stay at any of the high-end resorts in the Wolmar area outside the town, you'll uncover some stellar stretches of sand, glorious diving and a handful of palate-pleasing restaurants.</p>

Go for a ride in the nature by Quad, Buggy, Segway or try the only Via Ferrata in Mauritius. Feel the thrill of the longest zip line circuit in the Indian Ocean including hanging bridges or venture the hidden waterfalls of up to 20m height during a Canyoning tour.</p>

The Safari tour gives the opportunity to feed zebras and ostriches. Seize the once in a life-time opportunity to go <p>or a Walk with Lions and get your picture taken with them.

            		<p>Locals like to wax nostalgic about Tamarin Beach, and in many ways this sandy cove still feels like a throwback to earlier times – especially since the centrally located Tamarin Hotel looks like it hasn't been renovated since Jaws was in cinemas.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the area was known as Santosha Bay (you'll still find the word 'Santosha' scribbled on a few buildings in faded paint) and offered wave hunters some of the best surfing on the planet. In fact, before the bay earned the name Santosha, locals refused to give the beach a moniker because they didn't want outsiders to discover their cache of surfable seas!</p>

<p>Today the waves and currents have changed and surfing at Le Morne has really taken off, but Tamarin – unmarred by high-walled resort compounds – remains a popular place and during the evening live jazz tunes waft through the air.</p>

<p>The walk between Tamarin Beach and southern Wolmar is very scenic and not accessible by car (women are advised not to do it alone).</p>

            		<p>The large swath of beach-fringed land between Flic en Flac and Le Morne is known to most Mauritians as Rivière Noire (Black River). One of the island's last coastal areas to witness development, this constellation of townships has grown by leaps and bounds over the last few years as unsightly salt flats morph into stylish housing projects for South African expats, and traditional hunting grounds get reimagined as scenic zoos and cycling paths. Despite the sudden appearance of modern structures, Black River is a great place to base yourself for a more active and authentic experience. Sensational hiking, scenic shorelines, top-notch fishing and interesting historical relics are all within arm's reach.</p>

Le Morne Brabant Mountain, a dramatic basaltic rock peak dotted with caves that once harbored runaway slaves, presides over luxury resorts and a wide beach widely regarded as the best on the island. Throw in a shimmering turquoise lagoon and gorgeous sunsets and calling the town "paradise" doesn't seem like a cliché.</p>

            		<p>The Black River Gorges is worth visiting for all trekkers, as well as for the pure nature lovers and bird-watchers.</p>

					<p>The Black River Gorges is the largest national park in Mauritius. Famous for its waterfalls, vistas and hiking, the gorge is in the central highlands, making it cooler than much of the island.</p>

					<p>The "Black River Gorges" National park is a national park in the hilly south-western part of Mauritius. The park extends over an area of 6,754 hectares. With the help of the guides, you will discover Mauritius' natural heritage in this unique area which is also the location of one of the rarest forests in the world. It harbors about 311 species of native and endemic flowering plants and 9 species of birds, which are found only in Mauritius.</p>

					<p>This hike will take you into the heart of the indigenous forest with many panoramic views. You will also get to a river where you can have a swim.</p>

					<p>During the trip you will learn about the natives, the vegetation as well as on the endemic and exotic bird life.</p>

					<p><strong>The views you will encounter during this hike are breathtaking:</strong> A wide, beautiful gorge (canyon) curving dramatically down between a series of mountains. Beautiful waterfall scampering down the hillside with a range of mountains behind them and many more.</p>

					<p>The park protects most of the island's remaining rainforest. Many endemic plants and animals can be found in the park, including the Mauritian flying fox and all of the island's endemic birds: Mauritius kestrel, pink pigeon, Mauritius parakeet, Mauritius cuckoo-shrike, Mauritius bulbul, Mauritius olive white-eye, Mauritius grey white-eye and the Mauritius fody.</p>

            		<p>The “seven-coloured earth” of Chamarel is a geological curiosity and a major tourist attraction of Mauritius. This is a small (7500 m2) area of strikingly bare landscape located within a large, dense forest. The earth is particularly unusual; created by volcanic rocks that cooled at different temperatures, the earth form beautiful patterns of colour in the exposed hillsides. The rocks were pulverized into sands with various shades of red, brown, grey, and purple. Since the earth was first exposed, rains had carved beautiful patterns of many colours into the hillside. When visiting the park, you will be able to walk between the many sand dunes, along trails and see this unique sight. Also, there is a small petting farm where you can see and pet Giant Turtles which found their home at the park.</p>

            		<p>About 1km west of central Curepipe, the Trou aux Cerfs is a dormant volcanic crater some 100m deep and 1km in circumference. The bowl is heavily wooded and from the road around the rim – a favourite spot for joggers and walkers – you get lovely views of the plateau. There are benches for rest and reflection, and a radar station for keeping an electronic eye on cyclone activity.</p>

            		<p>Ile aux Aigrettes is a small (27 ha) island situated in the Mahebourg Bay, about 850 m off the south-east coast of Mauritius. Unlike the mainland which is of volcanic origin, Ile aux Aigrettes is made up of coralline limestone. It is home to the last remnants of dry coastal forest, once found around most of Mauritius.</p>

					<p>Like the mainland, Ile aux Aigrettes was affected by tree logging and land clearance, and the introduction of exotic animal and plant species almost destroyed the native fauna and flora. In 1965 the island was declared a nature reserve and our intense conservation efforts have resulted in the restoration of the forest and reintroduction of rare species that had long since disappeared from the island.lkers – you get lovely views of the plateau.
